Algorithms to Chose 

1) K nearest Neighbours - Simple , classic and easy to understand 

2) adaboost 
3) random forest 
both are ensemble algos 

Process 
1) Do some research on the algorithm
     	---- Get General understanding
	---- Explain it to a friend 
2) find sklearn documentation
3) Deploy it based on sampel code from Sklearn 
4) Make predictions 
5) Evaluate it 


I chose 2 models
k nn
Random Forest 
Accuracy for knn = 94%  for n=1, distance = weight
